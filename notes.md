Analytical Engine Presentation

History of the Engine
* First described in 1837 as a successor to the difference engine
* Famously programmed by Ada, countess of Lovelace
* Never built

What the Engine Means for History
* Turing Complete
* First imaginings of algorithmic efficiency

How the Engine Works
* Harvard Architecture (Completely separate memory and instructions, instructions aren't even read into memory, unlike today's Modified Harvard Architecture where instructions are stored in memory but aren't readily accessed)
* How all the parts work
* Thick punch cards not unlike Jacquard loom

Porting the Engine
* John Walker wrote the first emulator in 1997 as a Java applet, ported in 2017 to JavaScript

Writing for the Engine
* Commands and numbers
* Metaprogramming to introduce pointers and string printing
* Patterns
* Reliance on the Assistant and Libraries

Demos
* Demo of atom language
* Demo of mandelbrot viewer
