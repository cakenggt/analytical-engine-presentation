Analytical Engine Presentation

History of the Engine
* First described in 1837 as a successor to the difference engine
* Famously programmed by Ada, countess of Lovelace
* Never built
* Describe difference engine and give quote by Ada

What the Engine Means for History
* Turing Complete
* First imaginings of algorithmic efficiency

How the Engine Works
* Harvard Architecture (Completely separate memory and instructions, instructions aren't even read into memory, unlike today's Modified Harvard Architecture where instructions are stored in memory but aren't readily accessed. The instructions roller is litterally rolled forward and backward)
* How all the parts work
* Thick punch cards not unlike Jacquard loom

Porting the Engine
* John Walker wrote the first emulator in 1997 as a Java applet, ported in 2017 to JavaScript

Writing for the Engine
* Demo of atom language package for programming
* Commands and numbers
* Metaprogramming to introduce pointers and string printing
* Patterns
* Reliance on the Assistant and Libraries

Demos
* Demo of mandelbrot viewer
